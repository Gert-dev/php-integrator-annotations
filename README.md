This package provides annotations for your PHP source code using [PHP Integrator](https://github.com/Gert-dev/php-integrator-base).

**Note that the [php-integrator-base](https://github.com/Gert-dev/php-integrator-base) package is required and needs to be set up correctly for this package to function correctly.**

What is included?
  * Annotations for class methods that are implementing a method from an interface.
  * Annotations for class methods and properties that are overriding base class or trait members.
  * Tooltips on mouse over that clarify why the annotations are cluttering your gutter with additional icons.
  * Annotations for overrides and implementations can be clicked to navigate to respectively the method being overridden or implemented.

## Regarding donations
Donations were not my primary intention when releasing this project as open source, but I do accept them and am very grateful for any donation you may give. As such, a link to the (PayPal) donation screen is located [here](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=YKTNLZCRHMRTJ), at the bottom of the readme, hidden from initial sight and not even in the form of a fancy button ;-).
